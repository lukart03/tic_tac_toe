# tic_tac_toe

This project is a tic-tac-toe game written in the cubit architecture.

Cubit is used here to track the state of the application theme and font, 
as well as when choosing a game mode (PVE / PVP)

The application consists of two screens (playing field, settings)

On the screen with the field, the game process takes place directly, 
you can also select the game mode and restart the game using the corresponding buttons

On the settings screen, you can choose between 4 different app themes and between 4 different app fonts

# Good luck in the game!!!
